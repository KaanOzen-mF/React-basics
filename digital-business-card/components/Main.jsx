      <p className="main-text">
        First of all, I love to write code. Software development is like a
        strategy game. Firstly, you need to analyze the resources you have.
        After that, start developing a project based on these analyzes. I
        believe in the power of programming to transform and improve the lives
        of people around the world. I have been developing software using
        different project for the last 4 years. I am mainly keen width HTML,
        CSS, ReactJS, Javascript and Python. I have basic knowledge SQL and C#.

        I have a strong passion for watching films and TV series, with a
        particular geek-level fondness for "The Lord of the Rings." I also have
        a deep love for strategic games. I enjoy taking long walks, and during
        these walks, I like to listen to music and podcasts.
